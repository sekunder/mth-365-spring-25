body modification, and comportment, among others), the body politic 
(populations as monitored and controlled by governments), governmental 
bodies, corpora of literature and fine art, bodies of data, bodies of 
material culture, and geographic bodies such as land and water. Students
 will explore the intersections of these bodies through course readings,
 lectures, and participant observation (one of the signature methods in 
Anthropology) at instructor-designated settings. Through these 
experiences, students will become culturally literate in the places they
 visit, and gain basic proficiency in social science data collection,

Introduces non-biology major students to the basics of human anatomy and
 physiology. Normal functioning of the human body systems, human 
disease, human genetics, and human population and environmental issues 
are addressed. The primary goal of this course is to provide the student
 with a solid, working understanding of the function and occasional 
malfunction of the human body from an individual and global perspective.

This course will explore the general biology of the human body, 
including investigation into the cells and molecules that make up the 
body, exploration of organ systems, and discussions of disease. In the 
laboratory students will learn basic techniques used in various biology 
fields to discover new information. The students will then apply what 
they learned to design their own research question and test it. Overall 
the course will introduce them to science, how the human body works, and
 how it is studied. This course meets Magis Core Doing Natural Science

cause important diseases of humans, animals, and plants, most are not.

arts, and social/emotional teaching practices in programs for children 
birth to age 8. Emphasis is placed on understanding the principles and 
practices that support young children’s emerging literacy. It links the 
significance that oral language and early exploration has on later 
reading and writing skills. Focus will be placed on the role of play in 
influencing cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and language 
development. The course also identifies how the arts build interest, 
motivation, and learning in all curriculum areas. This course will 
include a 10-hour field experience, which will allow the students to put

We often think about emotions as individually experienced feelings that 
must be set aside to make way for rational, critical thinking. In this 
class, you will learn how the emotions you experience in everyday life 
are constructed by your community and our society, and how emotions can 
be a source of knowledge and insight. After becoming more aware of your 
emotional experiences in daily life, we will study the way that the 
emotions you experience as a reader of literature can give you insight 
into the functioning of emotions in human life. Satisfies Magis

 tropes and motifs do literary texts employ to represent the history, 
geography, and sensorial experience of the city? How do literary texts 
understand the fraught relationships between the city, nation, region 
and the world? The course will examine not only the representations of 
the city in literature but also how these literary texts might inform 
our own experience of urban places. Students will use research and 
scholarly writing to challenge simplistic narratives of urban capitalist
 transformation or urban decay and instead produce new knowledge that 
synthesizes the many contradictions that the city represents: between 
freedom and alienation, anonymity and entangled lives, feelings of 
strangeness and fleeting intimacies. Literature will provide us a unique
 vantage point for understanding the messy and complex realities of 
race, gender, class and sexuality in the city in a way that cannot be

<p class="courseblockdesc">
British Literature from 1880-1916 was dominated by the concept of 
adventure, stretching across the far reaches of the Empire. Tales of 
colonial exploration like Treasure lsland were meant to help construct 
imperial geographies and, at the same time, to help conceive imperial 
masculinities. Even though these were intended for boys, girls found 
their own adventurous literature that was bound up with renegotiations 
of gender, geography, and genre. This course will explore the 
interrelated concepts of imperialism, decadence, and the New Woman in 
order to understand the ways in which literature helped construct and 
subvert gender and Empire at the end of the nineteenth century. P:

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Our health affects every aspect of our lived experience; health care is 
shaped by access or denial--access to equity, dignity, and justice, or 
denial of them. Strengthening our narrative capacities can help us 
articulate the relationship between equity, dignity, justice, and health
 care as a holistic practice encompassing health, illness, healing, 
suffering, and death. This course begins from the premise that, on one 
hand, what medicine lacks--in singularity, empathy, humility--can, in 
part, be addressed by literary studies, and, on the other hand, medicine
 and health care can help literary scholars make their skills meet the 
social needs of the world around us. By integrating literature and 
medicine, we can create a world that is more equitable, dignified, and 
just. P: Critical Issues in Human Inquiry.<br>

This course investigates the extent to which the application of 
principles of justice, fairness and reciprocity can be correlated with 
economic well-being, eudaemonia and sustainability, for agents involved 
in economic activity. While pointing to the harmful effects of 
competition, growth and profit as measurements of economic success 
wealth disparities, and the unbridled pursuit of self-interest, the 
course invites students to consider the economic value of cooperative 
division of labor, balanced co-existence with the environment and with 
other humans, fair exchange and just wealth distributions, and the 
taking into consideration of the well-being of others in economic 
decision-making. Ultimately, students in the course will be encouraged 
to consider whether and how justice in economic practices may be 
effectively constitutive of economic value and the only warrantor of the
 viability and sustainability of a good life. P: Critical Issues in

The goal of the Global Perspectives in History: Rights and Revolutions 
course is to enhance students’ knowledge of significant ideas and 
development in the quest for greater human, political and civil rights 
in the West. The class will engage both primary and secondary sources in
 order to answer 4 basic questions in each unit: “who had the power and 
rights”, “what was life like for those without power and rights?”, “what
 rights were demanded?”, and “what was the outcome of the demand for 
these rights?” The text, supplemental readings, lectures, and films will
 provide the overview of those intimately involved in each movement. 
Discussion boards will evaluate the ideas of the era, and postings and 
papers will wrestle with the historical questions raised by each 
movement.

disability as resulting from various choices and assumptions that have

This course is an exploration and introduction to western music 
beginning in Antiquity and moving through the Baroque era. We will 
investigate the beginnings of music. Students will learn how the church 
and monarchy dominated formal education in mus¡c as we progress through 
this period. Eventually this elitism would lead to the rise of the 
middle class and the mass printing of music. The social and political 
trends of the time would not only dictate who played music and where it 
was played, but what type of music was composed. Students will learn 
about the significant composers that are associated with both the 
Medieval Period and Baroque Era so they can witness the impact these 
writers made on future generations of composition. Satisfies Magis Core:
