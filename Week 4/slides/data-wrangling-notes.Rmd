### What is Data Wrangling?

Most **Data Sets** are made up of *rows* and *columns*. They are  a collection of *values*: these can be *numbers* (quantitative) or character *strings* (qualitative)

**Data Wrangling** can be defined as the process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming  raw data into the desired format for analysts to use for prompt decision making. Also known as data cleaning.

### Why do you need this "Data Wrangling" Skill?

- Data wrangling helps to improve data usability as it converts data into a compatible format for the end system.

- It helps to quickly build data flows within an intuitive user interface and easily schedule and automate the data-flow process.

- Integrates various types of information and their sources (like databases, web services, files, etc.)

- Help users to process very large volumes of data easily and easily share data-flow techniques.

### Messy Data

Five main ways tables of data tend not to be tidy:

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.

2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.

3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

### What is tidy data?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../../Week 4/slides/images/tidy-data-illustration.png")

```

Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three principles of tidy data in almost every way imaginable! Even when they do, sometimes we don't need the whole data for analysis.

## Data is usually in a spreadsheet format, but

There are different ways of encoding the same information

.pull-left[
#### Option 1

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../../Week 4/slides/images/untidy1.png")

```

#### Option 2
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../../Week 4/slides/images/untidy2.png")

```
].pull-right[
#### Option 3
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../../Week 4/slides/images/tidy-data.png")

```
]

Neither 1 or 2 are "clean" versions of the data: information is part of the data structure; some implicit information is assumed

### dplyr

dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

Rules of `dyplr`:

- First argument is always a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always returns a data frame

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}

```

### dplyr uses the Pipe (%>%) Operator

Use the pipe operator to combine dplyr functions in chain, which allows us to perform more complicated data manipulations

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

+ Syntax:  dataframe %>% dplyr_function()
+ read %>% as "then do"
+ f(x) %>% g(y) is equivalent to g(f(x),y)
+ Recently `R` has developed the native pipe operator: `|>`

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

### dplyr Terminology

There are some of the primary dplyr verbs, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

`filter()`: Select specified rows of a data frame, produce subsets

`arrange()`: Reorder the rows of a data frame

`select()`: Select particular columns of a data frame

`mutate()`: Add new or change existing columns of the data frame (as functions of existing columns)

`summarise()`: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame

`group_by`: Introduce structure to a data frame
